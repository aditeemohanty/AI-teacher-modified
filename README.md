The AI-Teacher project is an innovative solution designed to simplify and enhance the learning experience for students, particularly during the high-pressure examination period. Students often struggle with lengthy PDFs and PPTs provided by faculty, which are difficult to process within limited timeframes. External resources like YouTube frequently fail to align directly with syllabus requirements, leaving students frustrated and stuck.
Our project addresses these challenges through:
A 3D virtual teacher that analyzes and teaches content interactively.
A doubt-solving feature for instant query resolution.
An activity tracker with a heatmap graph to monitor learning streaks and progress, motivating consistent study habits and helping students visualize their daily achievements.
With AI-Teacher, students can study smarter, stay organized, and tackle their syllabus effectively, making education more personalized, engaging, and efficient.

This project focuses on creating a virtual 3D avatar capable of performing accurate lip-syncing in real-time.
We have to upload the ppt/pdf you want to learn. It will analyze the text and feed the data to model to teach to students. AI model teaching by audio (uses tts) and text is been displayed on board. WITH THE HELP OF A 3D AVATAR.

It also had maths gesture solver, in which it solves the problem by analyzing the hand gestures what ever we write in the screen.
